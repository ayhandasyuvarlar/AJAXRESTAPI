# AJAXRESTAPI

##### Hello, I'm ayhan, in this article I want to show the process I made with ajax http requests -GET method. First of all, you create aclass class and add a constructor to it. You define a variable in the constructor and the task of this variable is to send a request to http, then create an object and go to the url from which you will get the "get" parameter and the data.Afterwards, you put this synchronous process into operation and you print the document wherever you want to print it.
